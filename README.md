## Welcome to open.evry.blog

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/evry-bergen/open.evry.blog/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content of Markdown formatted posts.

Whenever a change is merged to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the blog, from the content in the Markdown formatted posts and pages.

### Structure

| Path         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `_layouts`   | Contains HTML layout template for rendering markdown content |
| `_posts`     | Contains markdown formatted blog posts, see [#posts](#posts) for more information |
| `assets/css` | CSS overrides for the theme; this will be compiled automatically |
| `CNAME`      | Custom domain for GitHub Pages |
| `_config.yml` | [Jekyll configuration file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/) |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Docker Compose setup for [running locally](#local-development) |

### Posts

All posts are located in the `_posts` directory using [Markdown](#markdown) and [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). You can just look at existing blog posts to see the structure, but a simple example looks like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: The Hacker Mindset
---

Content goes here!
```

### Local Development

For running the blog locally for development purposes you only need Docker and Docker Compose installed. Clone the repository and run the following command from the repo root:

```
$ docker up
```

The blog will be accessible over port `:4000` and reload automatically on code changes. 

### Markdown

```markdown
